Dell Conagher: Where am I? When does this memory end??!
???: The dark and the light, they exist side by side. Sometimes overlapping, one explaining the other. The darkened path is as illuminated as the lightenedâ€¦
- Embrace the Light
	???: Light... our fates intertwined, thee hath chosen light, I shall not spare thee
	RUN OR TRAPPED FOR ETERNITY
- Resolve in Darkness
	???: I shall filleth thee full of darkness.
	RUN OR TRAPPED FOR ETERNITY
